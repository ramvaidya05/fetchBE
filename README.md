Hello! Thank you so much for taking the time to review my code. I had a fun time developing and testing it.

This project contains 4 files:
1) app.py
2) tester.py
3) summary.txt

You can open the files in any IDE of your choice.

1) app.py - contains the source code for the project with my implementations of /add, /spend, and /balance api's. THIS FILE DOES NOT NEED TO BE RUN.

2) tester.py - contains the test cases and function call to app.py, YOU CAN RUN THIS FILE to run the provided test case in the write-up to see if the code works as expected. If no assertion errors are returned on the terminal, you can assume the code runs well against the given test case.

3) summary.txt - contains my responses the questions in the write-up
